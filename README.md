## üå± Hi! I'm Richard üçµ

... a solar-powered, tea-fueled extrovert and recent NYU alum with a degree in computer science. Previously, I was a software engineer intern at JPMorgan under the investment banking division. I also taught Data Structures and Algorithms during the school year and helped organize the 2019 and 2020 cycles of HackNYU.

I have a diverse repertoire of interests that include playing [chess](http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?14612952), writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@richardshu1) and [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Richard-Shu-7), hosting a [podcast](http://itsoverpod.com), and making [YouTube videos](https://youtube.com/RichardShuProductions). I also love absorbing nature and embracing the outdoors through hiking and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/richard.shu.productions/).
