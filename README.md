## üå± Hi! I'm Richard üçµ

... a software engineer at Roblox based in LA. Previously, I wrote code at JPMorgan, taught Data Structures and Algorithms at NYU, and helped organize the 2019 and 2020 cycles of HackNYU.

I have a diverse repertoire of interests that include playing [chess](http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?14612952), making [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/RichardShu) videos, writing on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Richard-Shu-7) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@richardshu1), and hosting a [podcast](https://itsoverpod.netlify.app/). I also love absorbing nature through hiking and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/richard.shu.productions/).
