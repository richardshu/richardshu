## üå± Hi! I'm Richard üçµ

... a software engineer at Google in the Bay Area. Previously, I wrote code at Roblox and JPMorgan, taught Data Structures and Algorithms at NYU, and helped organize the 2019 and 2020 cycles of HackNYU.

In my free time, I like to play tennis, golf, and [chess](http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?14612952). I also like to thrift. When I'm feeling creative, I make [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/RichardShu) videos, write on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Richard-Shu-7) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@richardshu1), and post my [photography](https://www.instagram.com/richard.shu.productions/).
