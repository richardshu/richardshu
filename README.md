## üå± Hi! I'm Richard üçµ

... a solar-powered, tea-fueled extrovert and recent NYU alum. Previously, I wrote code at JPMorgan under the investment banking division. I also taught Data Structures and Algorithms during the school year and helped organize the 2019 and 2020 cycles of HackNYU.

I have a diverse repertoire of interests that include playing [chess](http://www.uschess.org/msa/MbrDtlMain.php?14612952), writing on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/profile/Richard-Shu-7) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@richardshu1), hosting a [podcast](https://itsoverpod.com), and making [YouTube](https://youtube.com/RichardShuProductions) videos. I also love absorbing nature through hiking and [photography](https://www.instagram.com/richard.shu.productions/).
